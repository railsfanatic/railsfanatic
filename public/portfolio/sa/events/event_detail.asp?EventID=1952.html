<tr><th class="normal">Event Notes:</th><td class="normal">On a windy evening, luck was not with the boys in their match.  SA started play with the wind and kept the Crew pinned in their own end of the field the entire half.  The boys repeatedly sailed shots just wide or to the keeper and went into the half scoreless.  In the second half, SA survived a huge scoring opportunity for the Crew at the start and then picked up where they left off in the 1st half.  The offense still could not find the net and the match ended 0-0.  Excellent job by Michael, Ryan, Chris and Austin on defense as they turned away all offensive threats.</td></tr></table>
