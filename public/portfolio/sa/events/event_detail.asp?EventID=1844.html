<tr><th class="normal">Event Notes:</th><td class="normal">The '89 Boys dominated the 1st half against the American Eagles club by jumping out to a 3 - 0 lead at halftime.  The first goal was scored by Jorge on a sweet left footer in the upper back post from a header assist from Gilbert.  The 2nd goal was headed in by Jorge on a cross from Gilbert (this one folks, was textbook!)  The 3rd goal started with a very nice ball handling display by Gilbert as he pulled out the keeper and was nicely finished by Kyler.  The Eagles scored once in the 2nd half to prevent the shutout.  Mitchell had 5 Saves in the match.  Soccer America improves their record to 4 wins, 3 losses.</td></tr></table>
