&nbsp;<br>After a night on the cruise ship across the North Sea which included all you can eat buffet, disco, casino and lots of soccer girls, the 87 boys arrived in Frederikshavn as scheduled.  A short ride brought the team to their school accommodations.  After light training and a shopping tour, the day was capped with the DANA CUP No. 1 parade and Opening Ceremony at City Stadium.  On Tuesday, the  boys had a chance to visit the internet trailer to catch up with folks from home.  More training to prepare for their first tournament game at 4:45 PM (9:45 AM local) against Skagen IK from Denmark.
