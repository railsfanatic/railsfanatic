&nbsp;<br>The 91 Boys White team captured 1st place in the Plano Premier Division III Fall Season with a 6-0-4 record.  The title gives them an automatic promotion to Division II in the spring.  After they did not meet their expectations in the Pre-Season Qualifying Tournament, the team set out to prove they were in the wrong division.  They went undefeated in league play and scored a league leading 22 goals while allowing only 6 (with six shutouts).  Coaches Kenneth Austin and Luis Moreno had the boys well prepared for each game and the results were excellent.  The boys are looking forward to competing in Division II in the spring.  Congrats to the 91 Boys White Team!!
