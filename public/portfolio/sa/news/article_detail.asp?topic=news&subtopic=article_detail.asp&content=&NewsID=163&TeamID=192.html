&nbsp;<br>'86 Red and '91 teams give each other support.  Many of the '91 players have been coming to our games to support their "Big" sisters.  The '86 red team are also on the '91 sidelines cheering their "Little" sisters on.<BR>
<BR>
The '86 red team is excited to be "BIG SISTERS" to our younger team.  We are proud of the '91's and wish them the best of luck on the remainder of their season.
