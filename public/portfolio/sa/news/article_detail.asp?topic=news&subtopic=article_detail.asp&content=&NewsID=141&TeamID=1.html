&nbsp;<br>The White team opened up the qualification tournament by winning their group and advancing to the championship round, which will be held next weekend at UTD.  Soccer America won their first game against Texas Spurs 8 to 0 & their second game against Arlington Strikers 4 to 0.  Our total team offense (since the Image Friendly) is 3.4 goals for per game & our team defense is 0.4 goal against per game.  Good luck ladies!!!
