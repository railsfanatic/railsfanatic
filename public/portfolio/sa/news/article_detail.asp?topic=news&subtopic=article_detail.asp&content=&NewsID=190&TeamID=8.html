&nbsp;<br>Although the Michael Brown Winterfest is friendly tournament and no final standing are given, it is still fun to compare results. Of the 22 teams in the under 12 division, no team finished better than the Soccer America Girls. With three wins, no losses and one tie, the girls ended up tied with two other teams for the best record. Three shutouts were record in the four game tournament to go along with six goals scored with a plus five goal differential. The players really showed marked improvement from last weekend play.  The team is working hard to prepare for their first league game February 15th.
