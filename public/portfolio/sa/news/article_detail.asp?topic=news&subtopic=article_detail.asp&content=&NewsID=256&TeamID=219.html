&nbsp;<br>Soccer America '92 took some big strides this week in their game against AYSES Warriors.  This was one of our more physical games, and the boys didn't back down from any challenges.<BR>
<BR>
The game opened with both sides creating some scoring chances.  Unfortunately, the boys conceded a couple of tough goals as the half approached.  There was no let down and the boys continued to push forward, work passes and create goal opportunities.  The team was still in the game until they conceded an unlucky third goal off a rebound midway through the second half.  Even down 3-0, SA continued to push the ball up and put pressure on the Warriors.  With the team pressing to score, the Warriors managed a fourth a goal in the final minutes.<BR>
<BR>
The team clearly played much better.  After good efforts against two of the top teams in the division and a good scrimmage this week, SA '92 White should expect some improved results over the next couple of weeks.<BR>
