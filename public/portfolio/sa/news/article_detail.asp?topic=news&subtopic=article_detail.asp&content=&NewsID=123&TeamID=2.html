&nbsp;<br>After a very long 48 hours, Soccer America was up by 8:30 AM and ready for a big day in Oslo, Norway.  After a mid-morning walk through town, they were ready for their first scrimmage at 1:30 (that's 6:30 AM our time).  They played Skjetten SK and lost 3-2.  The 2 teams will meet up again at the Dana Cup.  They will then watch a Norwegian league match and pro game.  The evening will be spent at Akerhus fortress and dinner at harbor entertainment complex.  Sunday morning the team will take a tram to Holmenkollern Olympic ski-jump for spectacular views, then to Vigeland Sculpture Park.  That evening they will embark on a 12 hour overnight cruise to Denmark with cabin accommodations, lots of restaurants, disco, shopping, movies and games.  They arrive in Frederikshavn, Denmark Monday morning.
