&nbsp;<br>The girls played against all Classic teams in the first round with the results going extreamly well. The weather turned hot for the first time all summer with temperature in the high 90’s and the humidity making the conditions for play extremely uncomfortable. <BR>
<BR>
Three very physical games were played on Saturday. The girls did not concede defeat in any of the games, resulting in the 91Girls advancing to the knockout round. <BR>
<BR>
The semi game was against a group of (very large) all-star players from Lubbock with Soccer America advancing with 1-0 win. In the quarterfinal game, against FC Dallas a Classic D1 team, the girls held onto 0-0 halftime score. In the second half, FC Dallas took control with final score going their way. <BR>
<BR>
The girls gave it their very best – our new teammates are really starting gel and all players, parents, coaches and fans are extremely pleased with the outcome. Way to go Soccer America!!!<BR>
