&nbsp;<br>Way to go ladies on your 1 - 0 victory over Texans South Saturday at the Image Friendly Tournament.  Soccer America out shot Texans 15 to 3 and clearly controlled the tempo of the game.  The first scoring attempt came off a blistering laces shot by Kayla Higginbotham that hit the top crossbar and bounced out of play.  The game winning goal came from a corner kick from Lindsey Harrison that pinballed around in the 6 yard box until Liz Bannister cooly put the ball in the back of the net.  Good luck against Andromeda and Image on Sunday.
