&nbsp;<br>After another great game on Saturday, the SA 93 girls are alone in first place in the Plano Premier Division 1 standings, at least for now.  On Monday night the girls will play an early season show-down with the second place team, Solar.  <BR>
<BR>
The game on Saturday was a defensive battle.  But Soccer America was able to get ahead on two goals from Logan, and hold on through a late charge from the scrappy Triumph FC squad.  The win gives SA a 2-0 record with 5 goals for and only 1 against.  To see the official standings, go to the PSA web site as follows:<BR>
