&nbsp;<br>First Win, Nearly!<BR>
Soccer America '87 Boys White team struck early off a great volley from Alex.  The goal was set up by a great serve from Mike.  The defense played well but could not withhold the storm from the Comets.  Kyle had several great saves to keep it close.  The score was 1 -0 at the half, but the Comets again came out strong and put in the equalizer about 5 minutes into the half.  They struck again about 10 minutes later.  The game stayed at 1-2 until about the 30 minute mark.  Clay put in a 30 yd. shot right over the head of the Comet goalkeeper.  2-2 was looking good with a couple of offensive opportunities.  The Comets came back to take the lead with about 5 minutes left in the game.  The final score was Comets 3 and Soccer America 2.
