&nbsp;<br>With two wins and one loss, the 91 girls have earned the right to advance to the second round of the LH Classic Qualifying Tournament. The girls found themselves with their backs against the wall with a heart breaking loss to Infinity in the first game. The girls took the lead in the game halfway through the second half with the first score of the game. Infinity then applied much pressure, eventually getting two hard fought goals for the win.<BR>
<BR>
In the second game, Soccer America scored two quick goals to set the pace and went on to win 2 to 1. In the last game on Sunday, the team, playing in suffering heat with a 2:50 start, controlled the game for a 1-0 win of the D’Feeters. <BR>
<BR>
The team now moves to the second round of games on August 10th and 11th, playing for the final spots in Lake Highlands Classic D2 league or a bye into the Plano D1 league.  Way to go Soccer America!<BR>
