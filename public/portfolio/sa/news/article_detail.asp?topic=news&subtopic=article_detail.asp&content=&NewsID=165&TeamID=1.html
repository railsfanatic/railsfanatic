&nbsp;<br>Soccer America White improved its league record to 8-0-0 with an impressive win over Longhorns by the score of 3 to 1.  Longhorn's only goal came by way of a PK.  Our defense has only allowed 4 goals all season (2 of those from PK's).  Liz Bannister, Lindsey Kahil, and Lauren Uremovich all finished with 1 goal each.  Marisa Carlson, Tina Corona, and Kristie Morgan all finished with 1 assist each.  Team offense is currently 3.13 and team defense is .5.  Next game will be against Dallas Texans.  See you there.
