&nbsp;<br>In 10th minute of the first game of the Qualifying Tournament Connor scored the first GOAL assisted by Luis after a great play by Trevis to bring the ball up. Shawn scored the second GOAL on an assist from Oscar.   The third GOAL was an unassisted goal by Oscar and proved to be the winning goal.  All the boys worked hard for the VICTORY.  They played a terrific game - Great Team Effort!!
