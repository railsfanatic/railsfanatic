&nbsp;<br>The ’91 Boys White team traveled to Austin over the Memorial Day weekend and returned as champions of Austin United Soccer Club’s Spring Cup Tournament.<BR>
<BR>
SA players and their families arrived in Austin on Friday night and were up early on Saturday for two of their four first round games.  Things started well for the boys as they defeated GP United by a score of 2-1.  However, their second match pitted them against their Plano Premier division rivals, Odyssey, and the result was a disappointing 0-2 defeat.  Despite the setback, everyone enjoyed themselves that evening with a team pizza party back at the hotel pool.<BR>
<BR>
Sunday started slowly for the boys as they battled the host Austin United squad to a 0-0 tie.  The result made it uncertain that they would advance to the next round but the boys were determined to finish strong.  And they did!  They gained max points with a convincing 7-0 victory over the GP United ’92 team and entered the semifinals as the #3 seed.<BR>
<BR>
The semi’s were played at scenic Slaughter Creek Park and SA took on a Vipers team from Austin on Monday morning.  The half ended 0-0 but the boys took the lead midway through the 2nd half and held on for a trip to the finals.  Awaiting them would be a familiar foe… Odyssey!<BR>
<BR>
In an exciting championship game the boys withstood an early assault from a determined Odyssey team and got to halftime even at 0-0.  SA became the aggressor in the 2nd half and looked like they would get the first score, only to see Odyssey punch one in for the lead.  The boys did not fold and kept up the offensive pressure throughout the 2nd half.  Their efforts were rewarded when they scored with a header off of a free kick and regulation ended 1-1.  Neither team could notch a score in overtime so the game headed to PK’s.  Odyssey scored first but SA responded by making their first 3 penalty kicks.  Meanwhile, Odyssey missed their second shot and had their 3rd shot blocked.  Their fourth attempt was also blocked and a wild celebration ensued as SA realized they had claimed the title.  <BR>
<BR>
A great team effort by all the boys resulted in a fitting end to a very successful 2002-03 season.  Congratulations to the ’91 Boys White Team!<BR>
