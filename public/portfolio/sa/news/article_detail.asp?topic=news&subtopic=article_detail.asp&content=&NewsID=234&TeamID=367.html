&nbsp;<br>What a grueling day it was on Saturday July 26th.  Three games in six hours under a hot Texas sun.  The boys played hard but came up short in games 1 & 2.  They rebounded in game 3 for a victory.  Coach Harrison rewarded them with Monday off.  The tournament will no doubt strengthen the team as they head into the qualifying tournament the first week of August.
