&nbsp;<br>Soccer America '92 used a retooled lineup and some hard work to turn in its best performance of the young season against Triumph FC.<BR>
<BR>
In the first half, both sides created a few scoring opportunities but were unable to put the ball in the back of the net.  Unfortunately, as the half drew to a close a misplayed ball allowed Triumph to take a 1-0 lead into the break.<BR>
<BR>
The second half saw some strong passing which allowed Fredrik T. to draw SA level with his first goal of the season.   The team created some additional scoring chances, but Triumph was able to score a second goal on a counterattack.  Shortly before the end of the game, an unlucky moonball provided Triumph with an insurance goal.<BR>
<BR>
Coach Jacob's new formation and lineup changes have clearly made SA '92 a more potent team offensively.  As the players learn the new positions and develop confidence in their shooting, the team will only get stronger.
