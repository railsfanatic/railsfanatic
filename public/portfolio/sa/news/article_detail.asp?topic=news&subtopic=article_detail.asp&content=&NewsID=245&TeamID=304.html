&nbsp;<br>Another great team effort from the 93 girls payed off today with a 4 - 0 shutout of the Texas Mustangs.  The defense played nearly flawlessly, only allowing a few shots on goal.  Meagan, Elizabeth and Haley combined to shut down any offensive push the Mustangs attempted.  And Sara came up big in the goal on those few chances the Mustangs got.  <BR>
<BR>
But most of the action stayed in the offensive zone for the Soccer America girls.  Jordan, Andie, Kate, Michelle and Raeann  all played outstanding in the middle, keeping the pressure in the offensive zone.  And Logan, Katie, Christa, Jessica and Emily all put great pressure on the goal all game.  Here's the goal recap:<BR>
<BR>
Goal 1:  Christa<BR>
A great defensive play by Haley to get the ball to Elizabeth, who made a great pass to Christa streaking down the middle of the field.  Christa made a nice move and crushed the ball past the goal from just outside the goal box.<BR>
<BR>
Goal 2:  Jessica<BR>
A sweet give and go from Andie set up Jessica for a beautiful shot from the right hand corner of the goal box.  <BR>
<BR>
Goal 3:  Logan<BR>
Another nice defensive stop by Lizzie sent the ball to Raeann down the left touch line.  Raeann centered the ball to Emily, who made a sweet pass to Logan down the left side of the penalty area.  Logan then finished with a great left-footed shot to the right corner of the goal.<BR>
<BR>
Goal 4: Christa<BR>
After another great defensive play by Haley and Elizabeth,  Emily sent a beautiful long pass up the center of the field to Logan who put the ball on goal.  When the Keeper fumbled the shot, Christa was there to put away the rebound.<BR>
<BR>
Strong play from <BR>
