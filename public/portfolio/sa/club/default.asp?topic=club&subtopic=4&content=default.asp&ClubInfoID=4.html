Soccer America is involved in the Tom Thumb Food and Pharmacy "Good
Neighbor" Program. Tom Thumb donates 1% of all spent dollars from Soccer
America Families to Soccer America Soccer Club. Our total purchases from
Tom Thumb in the first quarter of 2003 was $7,829.17, so Tom Thumb
will cut a check in the amount of $88.37 to Soccer America. Thank you parents and relatives of Soccer America for your support.<p>
If you are not involved with this program and want to help, just apply
for a Reward Card at Tom Thumb and ask them to apply code #
<span style="background-color: #FFEE00">6366</span> to the card.<p>

check in the amount of $10.69. Thank you everyone for your support!!<p>
