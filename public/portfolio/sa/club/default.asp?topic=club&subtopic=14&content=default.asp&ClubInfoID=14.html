<h2>Developmental Academies for Ages 8-10</h2>

<p>Soccer America provides professional coaching for the pre-select/ Club levels. 
    Teams are established and entered into the PSA League of Plano or Super Development 
    League of the YMCA based in Plano. These leagues allow <b>established</b> 
    “recreational” teams to play together creating an environment that is challenging 
    and highly competitive.</p>
  <p>Tim Trevino, the Club Director of Coaching assigns coaches suitable for the 
    team. The Soccer America Girl’s Academy is called <b>Liberty</b> and the Boy’s 
    Academy is called <b>Revolution</b>.</p>
  <p>Each team will play in the Soccer America/ Quickfoot 3v3 and 6v6 tournaments 
    over the summer. During the winter, the team will compete indoor. Based on 
    the teams location, indoor will be played either at Inwood Soccer Center in 
    Dallas, Soccer Spectrum in Richardson, American Indoor Sports Facility in 
    Carrollton or Blue Sky Sports Center in the Colony.</p>
  <p>U-9 and U-8 Academy teams will train once a week at the <b>Soccer America 
    facility</b> located on the SE corner of Custer and Legacy in Plano, with 
    their Soccer America coach and once a week with their parent coach. It is 
    optional if the team wants to train more than once a week with the Soccer 
    America coach. U-10 teams will train twice a week with the Soccer America 
    coach at the facility. The Club Goalie Coach, Geoff Leber, also provides goalkeeper 
    coaching. The leagues require that a parent coach is the only coach on the 
    bench during the league games. Soccer America coaches are allowed to be at 
    the game, but just observes.</p>
  <p>Quarterly meetings will be held with the parent coaches of the Academy teams 
    to provide information on events and current news.</p>
  <p>Uniforms are purchased through Total Soccer ((972) 769-2454) located on the 
    NW corner of Spring Creek and Coit. Uniforms are part of the sponsorship package 
    from addidas. Click on the <b>Uniform </b>tab to view the developmental gear.  
  </p>
  <p><b>Objective:       </b>To establish ground level skills and basic tactics 
    to the team in order to be prepared for Club soccer. Many of these skills 
    take time and there is a learning curve. By providing these Academies, Soccer 
    America teams will be fully prepared for Club level league tryouts and future 
    tournaments.</p>
