&nbsp;<br>Soccer America White defeated Dallas Texans last Saturday morning by the score of 1 to 0.  While the White Team had many scoring opportunities, it only took a single goal to secure the contest.  Lindsey Kahil scored the game winning goal on a brilliant 1v1 effort against Texans' goalkeeper, and the awesome play of our defenders and midfielders turned away any threats to our goal.  The White team will face Longhorns this Saturday at UTD.  Good luck ladies.
