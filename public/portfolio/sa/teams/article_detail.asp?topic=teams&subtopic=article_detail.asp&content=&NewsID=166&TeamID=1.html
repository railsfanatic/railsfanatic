&nbsp;<br>Soccer America White continued to move ahead in the league point totals by tying Jazz Saturday afternoon at UTD.  Although we had many scoring opportunities, including a rocket off the foot of Lauren Uremovich that bounced off the crossbar, none went into the goal.  Our defense (DeDee Belton, Ashley Giovannitti, Becca Holland, and Megan Theriot) continued its awesome play turning aside any threats to our goal.  Our last game of the fall season is tonight against Dallas Texans.  Soccer America White defeated the Texans in their last meeting by the score of 1 to 0.  Good luck ladies!!!
