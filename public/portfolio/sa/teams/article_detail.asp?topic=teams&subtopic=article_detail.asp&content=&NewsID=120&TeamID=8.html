&nbsp;<br>The Soccer America 91 Girls traveled down to Austin for the Spring Cup tournament. The girls played outstanding, only giving up one goal the whole tournament. They made it all the way to the championship game, only yielding to a higher division team in penalty kicks. After a full 90 minutes of soccer the score was even at 1-1 and was one of the best-played games by the girls for the entire year. It’s always great to come home with a big trophy! CONGRATULATIONS SOCCER AMERICA 91 GIRLS!
