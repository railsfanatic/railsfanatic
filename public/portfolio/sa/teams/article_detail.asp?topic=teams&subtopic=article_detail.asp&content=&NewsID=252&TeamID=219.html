&nbsp;<br>Soccer America '92 White opened its season Saturday against the North Dallas Thunder, hoping to build on the team's strong finish at the Tulsa Labor Day Tournament.  The game opened with our side creating some good opportunities, but we were unable to score.  Unfortunately, The Thunder used some strong finishing to open up a two-goal lead before the half.<BR>
<BR>
The last 15 minutes of the 2nd half saw SA play some determined soccer and we nearly got a couple of goals back, but it was not to be.<BR>
<BR>
While the boys suffered an obvious letdown after falling behind, they recovered and really played well in the second half, proving that they can be competitive in their division.  The team is still improving, and looking forward to next week's game against the AYSES Warriors.<BR>
