&nbsp;<br>The Soccer America '87 Boys White team played the CD Pumas to a draw on Sunday.  The boys struck first by a great goal from Mike V.  The Pumas struck back but it was not long before Stephen put on in to put the boys on top.  The '87 team had trouble with the set plays of the Pumas as they score twice within 10 minutes to take a 3-2 lead.  The boys did not give up but rather put some nice passes together and scored the equalizer with about 2 minutes to play.  The play  and effort was so much better than the week before.  The team has a back-to-back games on Saturday and Sunday.
