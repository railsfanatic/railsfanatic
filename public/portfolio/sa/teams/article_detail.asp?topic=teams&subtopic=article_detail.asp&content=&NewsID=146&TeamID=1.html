&nbsp;<br>Congratulations Soccer America White for winning your season opener against Storm by the impressive score of 6 to 1.  Storm's only goal came from a controversial PK early in the game.  However, Soccer America struck back quickly to even the score at 1 to 1 within minutes off a stunning full volley goal by Lindsey Kahil into the left upper 90!!!  Lindsey Harrison finished with an awesome 3 goals, Lindsey Kahil with 1 goal and 1 assist, Liz Bannister and Tina Corona with 1 goal each, Megan Theriot with 2 assists, Laura Slattery and Marissa Carlson with 1 assist each.
