&nbsp;<br>Congratulations Soccer America '86 White Team!!!  You all played extremely well in the '85 age group.  We want to acknowledge our awesome guest players: Becca Holland, Tara Schlinkman, & Lauren Uremovich.  You ladies did an awesome job this weekend.  We are very proud of you!!!  The first scoring opportunity in the championship game was by Lindsey Kahil, who received a pass & beat her defender for a 1v1 with the keeper.  The keeper got just enough foot on the ball to push it wide of the near post.  It looked like we were heading to overtime when Bluestreaks served a free-kick into the box & finished a header in the last minute of play.  Excellent job this weekend ladies.  We are looking forward to camp & Flame Fest.
