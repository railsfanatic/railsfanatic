&nbsp;<br>After going undefeated in the qualifying tournament over the weekend, the 93 girls earned the first seed in the top division of the Plano Premier League.  The team played one game on Saturday and two on Sunday, winning 4-0, 5-1 and 4-1 to earn the most points of all the teams in the tournament.  With the temperature hovering around 100 all weekend, the girls really showed incredible heart and endurance.  In the last game, they actually trailed 0-1 midway through the first half.  But shortly after the goal against, the team noticeably stepped up their play a notch.  Within two minutes they scored the equalizer, and went on to outplay the opponent en route to the 4-1 victory.<BR>
<BR>
Next up is the Plano Labor Day Invitational Tournament, where the girls will face teams from all over Texas and Oklahoma.  And they will no doubt get a chance to repay some of the teams that managed to defeat them at Lake Highlands.  Should be a fun weekend.  Stay tuned...
