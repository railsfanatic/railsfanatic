&nbsp;<br>The first league game of the Spring "03 Season began with a Soccer America "No Show".  The 87 Boys were outmatched in every facet of the game.  With constant pressure being applied by the Solar offense the Soccer America defense just could not weather the storm.  The game was a 0 - 1 half but soon into the second half Solar again applied the pressure and scored just 5 minutes into the half.  After it was all said and done the final score was Solar 4 and Soccer America 0.
