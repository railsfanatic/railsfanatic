&nbsp;<br>With an outstanding team effort, the Girls notched their first big win in tournament play on Sunday at the Lake Highlands qualifying tournament, a 4-1 victory over the Dallas Texans White.  It was an impressive display of hard work, patience,  and great team play that paid off with an outburst of 4 goals, and only one goal against.  Every player on the field contributed, with strong play at every position, and the outcome was never in question.<BR>
<BR>
Scoring Summary:<BR>
<BR>
Goal 1:  Emily<BR>
Emily took a beautiful throw in pass from Andie, juked a defender, dribbled in to the penalty area and fired a shot passed the lunging goal keeper.<BR>
<BR>
Goal 2:  Michelle<BR>
A great defensive clear by Haley to RaeAnn started a nice play down the left touch line.  Aggressive work by Logan and Emily in the corner resulted in a free kick from just outside the penalty area.  Christa's strong kick was deflected in front of the goal by a defender.  But Michelle was charging and was able to pick up the rebound and drill it to the back of the goal!  <BR>
<BR>
Goal 3:  Christa<BR>
Another outstanding defensive effort from Katie and Haley set up RaeAnn for another attack.  Raeann sent a nice pass to Logan, who was rewarded for her persistence when the goal keeper fumbled her shot.  Logan attacked the loose ball and made a pinpoint pass to Christa, who was in perfect position to redirect the ball in to the wide open net.<BR>
<BR>
Goal 4:  Elizabeth<BR>
Hard work from Courtney and Kate paid off when Kate hit Elizabeth with a nice pass down the right touch line.  Elizabeth worked her way inside the penalty area and ripped a sweet shot to the top of the goal!<BR>
<BR>
On the defensive side, specialists Meagan and Haley both had outstanding games, putting up a strong wall to hold the Texans to very few scoring chances.  And the goal keepers, Jordan and Sarah, were both outstanding, each making several nice saves to secure the win.  Katie played a great game on both sides of the ball, winning loose balls and generating a number of good scoring opportunities.  <BR>
<BR>
Great job girls!  Now let's get ready for the second round!
