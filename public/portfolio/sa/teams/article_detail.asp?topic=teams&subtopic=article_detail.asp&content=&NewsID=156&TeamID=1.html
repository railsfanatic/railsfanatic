&nbsp;<br>Soccer America's grip on 1st place was strengthened last Saturday by defeating Tejanos 2 - 0.  This victory keeps Soccer America in front of the pack with 15 points in league play.  Lindsey Kahil and Lauren Uremovich both finished with one goal each.  Marisa Carlson and Lindsey Harrison finished with one assist each, and Laura Slattery was awarded one assist for her efforts to secure the second goal.  Team offense is currently 3.2 goals/game, and team defense improves to 0.2 goal allowed.   Excellent work ladies!!!
