&nbsp;<br>The boys played probably some of their best team soccer in a while and came away from the weekend's qualifying tournament with one victory and a very disappointing tie.  They clearly outplayed the Tejanos but just couldn't stick the ball in.  There were numerous scoring opportunities which is encouraging and more than a couple of balls hit posts.  One more game against the top team and we'll find out what division we play in.
