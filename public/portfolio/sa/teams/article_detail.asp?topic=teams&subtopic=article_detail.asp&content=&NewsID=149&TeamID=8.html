&nbsp;<br>The Soccer America 91 Girls traveled up to Tulsa to compete in the BASC Invitational soccer tournament this past Labor Day. The outcome: first place for the team!<BR>
<BR>
A dominating defense lead the way, registering three shutouts and allowing only one goal in four games. The .25 goals per game average was lead by Ingie, Number 5, Lucky, and Nails. Strong midfield play contributed to the defensive showing – supporting the back line very well. The midfielders – Skillet, Bean, Ash, Mad Dog, Cee and Hammer moved the ball into scoring opportunities swiftly and effectively – often surprising their opponents.<BR>
<BR>
Forward play was outstanding with a total of 12 goals scored in the tournament. The attacking line, directed by Duce, Eight Ball, Abbs, Keeki, and Wheezie, supported each other very well and did what they need to do: put the ball in back of the net.<BR>
<BR>
According to coach Michael Aguilera, “The girls are starting to play as a team, just as I expect them to. I am very proud of the result of this tournament.”<BR>
<BR>
Way to go Soccer America 91 Girls! Congratulations!<BR>
