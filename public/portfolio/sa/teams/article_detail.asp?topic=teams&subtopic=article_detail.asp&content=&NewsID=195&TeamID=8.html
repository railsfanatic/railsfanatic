&nbsp;<br>The 91 Girls are pleased to announce that they have a teammate that made the OPD selection. L.W. (Eight Ball) has been selected for ODP. She impressed the Olympic Development coaches with her strong play and been selected to join the 90 pool, although most of the girls trying out were a lot older.  Her teammates are extremely proud of her! Go 8Ball!
