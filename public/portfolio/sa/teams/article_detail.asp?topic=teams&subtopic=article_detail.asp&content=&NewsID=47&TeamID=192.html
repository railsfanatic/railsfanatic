&nbsp;<br>Whew, that was a scorcher today wasn't it?!  Girls, you deserve a big hearty congratulations for coming out this afternoon in the 100+ temp and playing tough for the entire game.  I know our 1-0 score doesn't really reflect the many shots on goal we had, but we'll take it. All of you should be very proud of your hard earned win.<BR>
<BR>
We play two games next weekend. The first one at 3:oo on Sat. and the next one at 1:15 on Sunday. I'll hand out the schedule at Tuesday's practice.<BR>
<BR>
Again, Congrats!<BR>
<BR>
Adrienne, one happy manager
