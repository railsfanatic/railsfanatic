&nbsp;<br>The White Team soundly defeated Longhorns on Saturday morning by the impressive score of 5 - 0 staying in 1st place in LHGCL.  Lindsey Kahil finished with 2 goals, Kayla Higginbotham with 1 goal & 1 assist, Liz Bannister & Marisa Carlson with 1 goal each, and Lindsey Harrison & Lauren Uremovich with 1 assist each.  The defensive unit played very well and retained a clean score sheet.  Defense has only conceded a single goal in four league games, which was a controversial pk in game #1.  Our defensive goals against average improves to 0.25 in league play, and our offensive goal for average improves to 3.5.  Congratulations ladies, and good luck against Tejanos next Saturday at UTD #3 at 3:00.
