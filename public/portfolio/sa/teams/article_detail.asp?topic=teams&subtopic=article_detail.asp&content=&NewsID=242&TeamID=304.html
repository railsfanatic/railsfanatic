&nbsp;<br>It was an exciting weekend of soccer for the 93 Girls.  Unfortunately, the breaks just didn't go our way despite the impressive effort the team put out.  Everyone really played well all weekend, but the ball just would not find the net for our side.  Each game could truly have gone either way.<BR>
<BR>
Every girl on the team should be commended for continuing to work hard and keeping their heads up to the end.  They showed tremendous heart, and the victories will certainly come for this team as they continue to gel.<BR>
<BR>
And most importantly, we are all breathing a great sigh of relief with the news that Michelle suffered no fractures or serious damage from her collision on Sunday!  She may be back out playing in as soon as 3 days.  We will all pray for a speedy and full recovery.  <BR>
<BR>
Keep up the hard work girls!  Let's look forward to a successful weekend in Plano!!<BR>
