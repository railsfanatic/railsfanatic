&nbsp;<br>The 86' White team faced FC Dallas again Saturday at a rain-soaked Moss Field.  Soccer America went into halftime with a 1 - 0 lead provided by Liz Bannister.  Liz received a perfect pass from Lindsey Kahil (14th of the season) and beat FC's keeper 1v1 to put the ball in the back of the net.  This was Liz's 4th goal of the season.  Luckily for FC, they tied the score with a shot that bounced off the top crossbar and "pinballed" into the net.  Two of the last three meetings have resulted in 1 - 1 ties; not to mention the 3 - 0 defeat of FC Dallas in the Fila Cup.  The '86 team moves into fourth place with 27 points.  Only 4 points separate them from 2nd ranked FC Dallas.  Good luck against top ranked Lightning on Monday!
