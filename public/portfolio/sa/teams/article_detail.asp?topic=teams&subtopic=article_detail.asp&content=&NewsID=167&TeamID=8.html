&nbsp;<br>The 91 Girls soccer team has earned first place in the Fall Premier Division II league. With an 8-2-0 record for the season, the girls have earned an automatic advancement to play in the Premier Division I league for the spring season. Although games are still being played in the league, no team can overtake the Soccer America squad in the standings. <BR>
<BR>
The 91 Girls recorded seven shut outs in the ten game season, only allowing four goals the entire season.  16 goals were scored during league play resulting in a league leading, including the Division I teams, goal differential of plus 12.  <BR>
<BR>
Strong finishes in the final part of the game – applying much pressure on the offensive zone with defenders sneaking into the attack – became a trademark of the season. According to Coach Aquilera “The girls worked hard on their conditioning and team play during our practices this fall. I think that really showed in the final minutes of our games. I am extremely pleased with the effort and commitment of this team. I am looking forward to our upcoming tournament play and indoor season this winter.”<BR>
<BR>
Continued Aquilera, “We are moving up to the next level in the spring. I know the team is looking forward to the added challenge and will continue their hard work and dedication to become better soccer players.”
