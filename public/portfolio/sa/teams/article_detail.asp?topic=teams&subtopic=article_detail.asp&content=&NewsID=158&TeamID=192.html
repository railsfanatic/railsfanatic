&nbsp;<br>Our fundraiser in Lewisville was a huge success.  We raised lots of money and had a great time in the process.  The girls worked very hard and didn't have one spill (just a few parents. :)<BR>
<BR>
Thank you to all of our SA parents for putting in your time too!  Sonic was so impressed, they wanted to hire a few.  WOW Mel, you worked circles around many.  And remember the next time we work Sonic to not let Julie run the scan machine.  Jammed it again and again!!!!  A GREAT TIME BY ALL.
