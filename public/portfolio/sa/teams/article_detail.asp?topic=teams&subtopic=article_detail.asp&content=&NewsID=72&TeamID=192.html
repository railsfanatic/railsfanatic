&nbsp;<br>Many on this team were hurting at the beginning of the tournament on Friday night.  Jessie Boccia had strep throat, although you would never know it, Lindsay Gill was getting something like strep and Jackie Otis' quad still would not get better.  Did illness or hurtness stop our ladies?  NOOOOO.  <BR>
Did getting hit in the gut, slapped by the ball or get hit in the knee (Ashley) slow them down??? NOOOOO<BR>
What a team, what spirit , what are they thinking?????
